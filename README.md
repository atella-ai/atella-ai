# Hi, I'm Amar 👋

I build **AI agents for developers and DevOps teams** – not just chatbots, but systems that actually **watch builds, read logs, trigger deployments, and automate real engineering work.**

Most of my work is hands-on and production-minded:

- AI agents for CI/CD, observability, and infra
- Multi-agent workflows for complex engineering tasks
- MCP-based tools for GitLab, AWS, and cloud resources
- LLM-powered developer copilots and internal bots

---

## 🧠 What I Do

- **DevOps Agents** – agents that monitor pipelines, analyze failures, suggest fixes, and restart jobs  
- **Build & Release Automation** – agents that watch GitLab/GitHub, manage environments, and trigger QA/Prod deploys  
- **MCP Tools** – safe, scoped tools for interacting with logs, config stores (AWS Parameter Store), and infra  
- **Developer Productivity** – code review helpers, doc generators, test generators, project bootstrappers  
- **Agent Architectures** – planning, tool calling, memory, eval for real-world engineering use cases

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- Software Developer → **AI Agent Builder & AI Evangelist**  
- Focused on **MCP, AWS, Python**, and GitLab CI/CD  
- I love turning repetitive engineering tasks into **reliable, observable AI workflows**  
- Enjoy teaching teams how to adopt agentic systems safely and effectively

## 🚀 Start Here

I’m building out a set of **practical, clone-and-run examples** of AI agents for:

- CI/CD monitoring & auto-recovery  
- Log analysis + alerting + remediation  
- Release notes & changelog generation  
- Internal dev copilot workflows

👉 Check out the pinned repositories below (soon™) for working examples.

If you’re building in this space or want to collaborate on AI agents for engineering, I’d love to connect.
